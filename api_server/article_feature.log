### Bugatti in PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS

The hyper sports car that transcends all limits of luxury and performance — the incomparable Bugatti Chiron roars across the Battlegrounds.

Bugatti, designer of hyper sports cars combining elegance and performance, is more than just a car brand. For over a century, it has defined the pinnacle of design, speed, and technology without compromise. Hand-assembled in Molsheim, France, every Bugatti embodies the brand’s ethos of excellence in design and engineering, captivating enthusiasts around the world.

Even in the earliest days of handcrafted automobiles, Bugatti stood out with unmatched precision and innovation. Its legacy is simply incomparable.

Through the PUBG x Bugatti collaboration, players can take the wheel of the Chiron, the ultimate symbol of performance and comfort. A modern reinterpretation of Bugatti’s iconic history, the Chiron pushes boundaries beyond imagination, combining sophisticated design, performance-oriented form, and a whole new dimension of comfort. **With only 500 units ever made, the Chiron’s striking presence and elegance now await you on the Battlegrounds.**

Step into the world of PUBG x Bugatti, where every drive defies expectations — because nothing else compares.

*If comparable, it is no longer Bugatti.*

[![Bugatti Special Vehicle Skin](https://wstatic-prod-boc.krafton.com/common/news/20250812/oHJugUBJ.jpg)](https://wstatic-prod-boc.krafton.com/common/news/20250812/oHJugUBJ.jpg)

Details on the Bugatti Special Vehicle skins are as below.

***※ Special Vehicle skins transform the existing vehicles to reflect the designs of the actual vehicles, and these Special Vehicle skins are developed to ensure a faithful representation of the actual vehicle's 3D modeling. Please note that equipping the Bugatti Special Vehicle skins may result in slight alterations to the base vehicle's size and appearance. These alterations are similar to those of the previous Special Vehicle skins.***

#### Common Features

- When equipping a Special Vehicle skin, the following effects will apply:
    + Vehicle appearance is changed.

- Lobby animations are applied for each skin.
- The signature number badge is displayed on the front horseshoe grill when certain paint items are applied.

##### Carbon Fiber

- Parts of the vehicle’s rear and engine cover are made of carbon fiber.
- Carbon fiber is a penetrable material, allowing bullets to pass through and inflict damage upon the player.
    + If the player is shot through the carbon fiber material, both the vehicle and the player will take damage.
    + Damage is applied to the vehicle when the bullet penetrates the carbon fiber area, but there is no additional damage caused by the bullet hitting the inside of the vehicle post-penetration.
- The carbon fiber material can only be penetrated by bullets.
